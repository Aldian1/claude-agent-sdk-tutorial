## Executive Summary of Findings

The GameStop saga represents a watershed moment in financial history where retail investors on r/WallStreetBets challenged institutional Wall Street, driving GME from $17.25 to $500+ in January 2021. Led by Keith Gill (Roaring Kitty) and amplified by Ryan Cohen, the event caused billions in hedge fund losses and fundamentally changed market dynamics.

**Key Insights:**
- **Cultural Impact**: "Diamond hands," "apes," and "tendies" became mainstream financial terminology
- **Market Power Shift**: Retail investors now comprise 25% of total equity trading (doubled from pre-2021)
- **Regulatory Changes**: Settlement cycle shortened to T+1, increased payment-for-order-flow scrutiny
- **Bloomberg's Framing**: Characterized as "rage against the financial machine" - a cultural uprising beyond profit
- **Current Status (Dec 2025)**: GME trades at $22.95 (down 95% from peak) despite business improvements
- **Lasting Influence**: Keith Gill's 2024 return triggered 179% price surge, demonstrating continued cultural impact

**Long-Term Reality**: Academic research shows WSB-hyped stocks deliver negative long-term returns (-8.5%), confirming that while social coordination can temporarily overcome fundamentals, market gravity eventually reasserts itself.
