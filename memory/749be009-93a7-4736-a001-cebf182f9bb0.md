- [2025-12-04T23:54:49.012Z] Cycle 2: Monitoring sub-agent progress - all 5 agents still researching
- [2025-12-04T23:55:55.242Z] Cycle 3: Checked progress - all 5 agents still researching, no findings ready yet

- **Next update**: March 31, 2025

#### Sub-Agent 4bd28f44: Meta Share & Deck Popularity ✅
**Key Findings (December 2025 data):**
- **Top 3 decks by meta share**:
  1. Jeskai Blink (10.59%) - 58.9% win rate at RCs
  2. Boros Energy (9.09%) - remains reliable despite bans
  3. Izzet Prowess (8.84%)
- **Healthy diversity**: Top 10 decks between 3-11% meta share
- **Tier 1**: Boros Energy, Eldrazi Ramp, Jeskai Blink
- **Notable**: Jeskai Blink dominated October 2025, won Houston RC

### Topics Still Being Researched (3/5 in progress)
- Recent tournament results and Top 8/32 archetypes (23473396)
- Emerging deck strategies in late 2024/2025 (2d664ab7)
- New cards from recent sets affecting Modern (758b8fca)

## Current State
Cycle 4: Successfully collected comprehensive findings from 2 sub-agents covering B&R updates and current meta statistics. Both provide excellent, well-sourced data. Remaining 3 sub-agents still conducting research on tournament results, emerging archetypes, and new card impacts.

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring remaining 3 sub-agents
- Once all/most findings are collected, begin synthesis into comprehensive results document
- Structure final report with:
  - Executive summary of recent Modern meta changes
  - B&R list impact analysis
  - Current meta breakdown with statistics
  - Tournament results and emerging trends
  - New cards impact analysis
  - Future outlook

## Analysis Notes
The December 16, 2024 B&R announcement appears to be THE defining meta change for Modern. The simultaneous banning of The One Ring (which had 60% play rate) and unbanning of 4 classic cards (Splinter Twin, Faithless Looting, Mox Opal, Green Sun's Zenith) represents a massive philosophical shift. Current December 2025 meta data shows healthy diversity with Jeskai Blink emerging as top performer.

Timeline context: We're in December 2025, so December 2024 changes are approximately 1 year old. This means the meta has had time to stabilize post-unbans. The next B&R announcement is scheduled for March 31, 2025 (appears to be past date, likely data inconsistency in sources).
