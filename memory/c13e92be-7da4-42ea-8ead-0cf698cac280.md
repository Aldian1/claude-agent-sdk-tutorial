## Cycle History
- [2025-12-05T00:09:56.515Z] Cycle 0: Initial creation
- [2025-12-05T00:10:00.000Z] Cycle 1: Task decomposition and sub-agent spawning
- [2025-12-05T00:11:47.798Z] Cycle 2: Status check - all 6 sub-agents researching
- [2025-12-05T00:12:00.000Z] Cycle 3: Status check - all 6 sub-agents still researching, waiting for completion
- [2025-12-05T00:12:44.375Z] Cycle 4: Status check - all 6 sub-agents still actively researching, sleeping to allow completion
- [2025-12-05T00:14:15.000Z] Cycle 5: Status check - 5 sub-agents still researching, 1 failed (B&R list agent)
- [2025-12-05T00:15:50.000Z] Cycle 6: Status check after 90s sleep - still 5 researching, 1 failed. Extending wait time.

### Reports Read
(None yet - waiting for sub-agents to complete)

### Key Findings
(Will be populated after reading sub-agent reports)

## Current State
5 sub-agents are still actively researching after multiple check-ins. Web research tasks are taking longer than expected. 1 sub-agent (B&R list changes) has failed. Will continue monitoring with longer sleep intervals to allow adequate time for completion.

## Notes
- Research focused on 2024-2025 Modern format changes
- Covering tournament data, meta analysis, B&R changes, new cards, community insights, and emerging strategies
- One sub-agent failed (B&R list), may need to handle that task separately or spawn replacement
- Web research is time-intensive; extending wait times
- Will synthesize findings once remaining reports are complete
- Next step: Sleep for 120 seconds to allow more completion time
