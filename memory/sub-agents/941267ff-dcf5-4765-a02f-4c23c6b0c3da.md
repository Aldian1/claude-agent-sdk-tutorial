### Key Findings

## 2024 MODERN BANNED & RESTRICTED UPDATES

### December 16, 2024 (MOST SIGNIFICANT UPDATE)
**BANNED:**
1. **The One Ring** - Had 60% play rate in Modern, dominant in Boros Energy deck for 18 months
2. **Amped Raptor** - Targeted ban to weaken Boros Energy strategy
3. **Jegantha, the Wellspring** - Companion restriction reducing deck-building creativity

**UNBANNED:**
1. **Splinter Twin** - Originally banned in 2016, format evolved enough to handle it
2. **Faithless Looting** - Previously banned after Hogaak era, new graveyard hate exists
3. **Mox Opal** - Classic artifact acceleration card
4. **Green Sun's Zenith** - Popular green tutor card

**Rationale:** Wizards received feedback about "good old days of Modern" before Modern Horizons sets. This represents a call back to earlier Modern formats with nostalgic unbans.

### August 26, 2024
**BANNED:**
1. **Nadu, Winged Wisdom** - Acknowledged design mistake, 25.3% of Pro Tour decks, 59% of Top 32 with 59% win rate
2. **Grief** - Also banned to address format concerns

**Context:** Nadu was a late-design change that wasn't properly playtested. Synergy with 0-mana abilities (Shuko) created dominant combo strategy.

### May 13, 2024
**NO CHANGES** - Format deemed healthy after previous Violent Outburst ban, able to absorb Modern Horizons 3 release.

## UPCOMING ANNOUNCEMENTS
- **March 31, 2025** - Next scheduled announcement
- Wizards will monitor impact of December unbans during Regional Championship season
- New cadence aligns with competitive seasonal offerings

## Current State
Research complete - comprehensive findings compiled covering all 2024-2025 Modern B&R updates

## Notes
- December 2024 update represents one of most dramatic B&R announcements in Modern history
- Shift in Wizards philosophy: addressing power creep from Modern Horizons sets by unbanning classic cards
- Four unbans in single announcement is unprecedented in recent Modern history
- The One Ring ban addresses 18-month dominance issue
- Nadu acknowledged as design failure, even Pro Tour winner advised against investing in deck
