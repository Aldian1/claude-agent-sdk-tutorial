## Current State
Research completed. Comprehensive findings compiled covering:

- Key card identification and analysis
- Ban/unban timeline and rationale
- Metagame evolution from mid-2024 to present
- Archetype development and shifts

## Notes
Modern Horizons 3 was the most impactful set for Modern in the 2024-2025 period, fundamentally reshaping the format with the energy mechanic and multiple powerful cards. The format experienced significant turbulence with multiple bans required, followed by an experimental unbanning period in December 2024. Standard sets had minimal impact compared to MH3. The format appears healthier and more diverse after the December 2024 changes, though it's still adapting to the unbanned cards.
